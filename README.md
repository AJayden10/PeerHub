PEERHUB!
Project Overview

PEERHUB is a peer-to-peer online marketplace designed to simplify and optimize the buying and selling of new and used goods. Our core innovation is an algorithm-driven "fair market value" suggestion for sellers, ensuring competitive pricing and transparency. SRM aims to provide a seamless, secure, and intelligent platform for anyone looking to engage in the second-hand economy or find great deals on new items.

Core Concept

Peerhub connects buyers and sellers directly, allowing users to easily upload items, receive an algorithm-determined "fair market value" suggestion, and list them for sale. The platform prioritizes user experience, leveraging data to inform pricing and streamline transactions.

Target User

Our target audience includes anyone interested in buying or selling goods, from casual individuals decluttering their homes to frequent flippers seeking to capitalize on market trends. Whether you're looking for a bargain, selling an unused item, or finding competitive prices on new products, SRM is for you.

Key Features & Workflow Design
I. User Onboarding & Account Management
Registration/Login

Action: User initiates "Sign Up" or "Log In."

Workflow:

New User: Standard email/password registration, or quick sign-up via Google/Facebook Single Sign-On (SSO). Gathers basic profile information like name and location to facilitate local pickup suggestions.

Returning User: Login via email/password or SSO.

Additional Features:

Email verification for new accounts to enhance security.

"Forgot Password" functionality for account recovery.

Profile picture upload for personalization.

User Dashboard/Profile

Action: User logs in and is directed to their personalized dashboard.

Workflow:

Displays active listings for sellers.

Provides a history of past sales and purchases.

Allows management of payment methods (for both receiving funds as a seller and making payments as a buyer).

Enables updating of shipping addresses.

Features a notification center for messages, offers, and accepted sales.

II. Selling an Item Workflow
Initiate Sale

Action: User clicks on a prominent "Sell an Item" or "Upload Item" button.

Item Details Input (Crucial for Algorithm)

Action: User completes a form with comprehensive item specifics.

Workflow:

Item Category: Mandatory dropdown (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Home Goods, Books, Food). This is a vital input for the pricing algorithm.

Item Name/Title: A concise, descriptive title (e.g., "iPhone 13 Pro Max, 256GB," "Zara Denim Jacket, Size M").

Description: A detailed text field for item specifics (e.g., "Used for 1 year, minor scratches on screen, battery health 90%").

Condition: Dropdown/Radio buttons (e.g., New, Like New, Good, Fair, Worn).

Brand/Manufacturer: Text input.

Model/Version (for electronics): Text input (e.g., "A2643").

Color/Size (for clothing): Dropdown/Text input.

Original Purchase Price (Optional): Numeric input, highly valuable for the algorithm.

Date of Purchase (Optional): Date picker.

Upload Photos: Multiple image upload with drag-and-drop functionality, essential for credibility and future image recognition.

Data for Algorithm: The combination of Category, Name, Condition, Brand, Model, Original Price, and potentially image data forms the input for the "Fair Market Value" algorithm.

Fair Market Value Suggestion (Algorithm Interaction)

Action: After submitting item details, the system displays the algorithm's suggested price.

Workflow:

The backend Machine Learning (ML) model processes the input data.

Displays a suggested price range (e.g., "$180 - 
200").

Provides a simple explanation for the suggestion (e.g., "Based on similar items sold recently in 'Good' condition, with an average depreciation of 30%").

Seller's Choice: The seller can accept the recommended price, adjust it within a defined percentage range (e.g., +/- 15%), or set their own price (with a warning if it deviates significantly from the recommendation).

ML Algorithm (Simplified):

Initial Approach: Weighted Linear Regression or Decision Tree Regression.

Features: Item Category (one-hot encoded), Condition (ordinal encoding), Brand (one-hot/embedding), Model (text/embedding), Age of item (calculated from purchase date), Original Price.

Target: Historical selling price of similar items.

Data Source: Initially, manually collected or scraped data from existing marketplaces (e.g., eBay, Craigslist, Amazon).

Future Enhancement: Integration of image features for more accurate assessments.

Listing Confirmation & Publishing

Action: Seller reviews all details and sets shipping preferences.

Workflow:

Shipping Options: User can select "Local pickup only," "Seller ships" (with cost input), or "Buyer pays for shipping" (calculated based on item weight/size).

Payment Method: Confirmation of where the seller wishes funds to be deposited.

Publish Listing: The item goes live on the marketplace.

Additional Features:

A preview function to see how the listing will appear to buyers.

Option to "Save as Draft" for unfinished listings.

Automated notification to the seller once the item is successfully listed.

III. Browsing & Purchasing Workflow
Homepage/Browse Listings

Action: User lands on the main page or clicks "Browse Items."

Workflow:

Displays a curated grid or list of featured items.

A prominent search bar for quick item discovery.

Category filters (Electronics, Clothing, etc.).

Sorting options (Price Low-High, Newest, Condition).

Search & Filter

Action: User utilizes the search bar or applies filters to refine their search.

Workflow:

Keyword Search: Search by item name, brand, or description.

Category Filter: Drill down into specific categories.

Price Range Filter: Set minimum and maximum price limits.

Condition Filter: Filter by "New" or "Used."

Location Filter: For local pickup items (e.g., "within 20 miles of my zip code").

View Item Details

Action: User clicks on a specific listing to view more information.

Workflow:

A large image gallery for detailed viewing.

Comprehensive description and condition details.

Seller's name and rating for credibility.

Shipping details and associated costs.

"Fair Value Check": Displays the algorithm's price suggestion for the specific item and compares it to the seller's price (e.g., "This price is 5% below our recommended fair value!").

Action Buttons: "Add to Cart" (if multiple items are allowed), "Make an Offer," "Buy Now," "Message Seller."

"Related Items" section, offering suggestions based on the viewed item.

Making an Offer / Buying Now

Action: User decides to purchase or negotiate.

Workflow:

"Buy Now": Direct checkout process.

"Make an Offer": User inputs a proposed price, which is sent as a notification to the seller. The seller can then accept, decline, or make a counter-offer.

Messaging System: An integrated chat for direct communication between buyer and seller, useful for discussing item details or arranging local pickups.

Checkout & Payment

Action: User proceeds to finalize the purchase.

Workflow:

Review of the order summary (item, price, shipping, tax).

Selection or addition of a shipping address.

Selection or addition of a payment method (Credit Card, PayPal, Stripe).

Confirmation: "Order Placed" message displayed, with email confirmations sent to both buyer and seller.

Security: Integration with robust payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) to ensure secure transactions.

IV. Post-Sale Workflow
Shipping/Local Pickup

Action: Seller and buyer fulfill the order.

Workflow:

Seller receives a notification of the sale and a shipping label (if applicable).

Seller marks the item as "Shipped" or "Picked Up."

Buyer receives tracking information or instructions for local pickup.

Order Completion & Funds Release

Action: Buyer receives the item and marks it as "Received."

Workflow:

Funds are held in escrow by the platform until the buyer confirms receipt.

Upon confirmation (or after a pre-defined period), funds are released to the seller's account.

The platform collects a small commission on the sale.

Rating & Review

Action: Both buyer and seller provide feedback on the transaction.

Workflow:

A pop-up or email prompt encourages users to leave a rating (1-5 stars) and an optional text review.

These reviews contribute to the seller's and buyer's reputation scores on the platform.

Future Enhancements

As SRM grows, we envision integrating advanced features to further enhance the user experience and platform efficiency:

Image Recognition for Categories/Condition: Leveraging advanced ML to automatically suggest item categories or even assess item conditions based on uploaded photos.

Price Drop Alerts: Notifying users when items they've favorited or expressed interest in experience a price reduction.

Want Lists: Allowing users to specify items they are looking for and receive notifications when such an item is listed.

Integrated Logistics: Partnering with shipping carriers to provide easier label generation, tracking, and potentially discounted shipping rates.

"Bundle Deals": Enabling sellers to offer discounts for buyers purchasing multiple items from their listings.
